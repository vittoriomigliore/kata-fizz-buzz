# FizzBuzz TypeScript Implementation

This project is aimed at learning TypeScript and Test-Driven Development (TDD) by implementing the FizzBuzz kata.  
FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem that involves printing numbers from 1 to 100, with specific rules applied for multiples of 3, 5, or both.


## Problem Description

Imagine being in a classroom where the teacher introduces a game called FizzBuzz. The rules are simple:

- Count from 1 to 100.
- If the number is divisible by 3, say "Fizz" instead.
- If the number is divisible by 5, say "Buzz" instead.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, say "FizzBuzz" instead.

## Stage 2 - Additional Requirements

In this stage, new requirements are introduced:

- A number is considered fizz if it is divisible by 3 or if it contains the digit 3.
- A number is considered buzz if it is divisible by 5 or if it contains the digit 5.

## Sample Output

Here's how the output should look like based on the given rules:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
19
Buzz
... (continues up to 100)
```

# Setup

The only requirements on your computer are: 
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 

Then, clone it and install dependencies running the command `make install` from your terminal, in the root folder of the project.  
After dependencies are installed, you can run tests via `make test`.

## TDD Course

This project is being used as a practice exercise alongside the email course [Test-Driven Development 101](https://learnagilepractices.gumroad.com/l/tdd-101-email-course) by [Daniele Scillia](https://danthedev.carrd.co/).  
The course has been instrumental in learning TDD principles and techniques.
